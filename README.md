# CTF-tips
Repository to write down tools and experiences in 
order to help others on the team to solves future tasks.

## Contribution
You are more than welcome to contribute to help
yourself and others for the coming CTFs.

To contribute, do the following:
1. Fork the repository
2. Make a branch for you to make your changes in. `git checkout -b [branch-name]`.
    * Clear and concise language. Try to write so 
    that a 7-year kid would understand :)
    * Please don't exceed 80 characters per line.
    This makes it a lot easier to read markdown.
3. Make a pull request, and we will approve it. 

Don't be afraid to try and fail with git in this 
repository. This is good training for future git use.
You will most likely never get a job that does not
use git for their projects. :)
